The SIP RTCP Report Reaper is a voice quality analysis tool I wrote in the
Spring of 2010 when I was between contracts.  There are two modes of operation
for the reaper.  It can sniff packets for RTCP reports and RTCP voice quality
reports and generate a publish message to a third party with a voice quality
report or it sniff for RTP packets and attempt to generate its own voice
quality report.  This is all in accordance with the following RFC:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-johnston-sipping-rtcp-summary-08

The idea is to use a inexpensive device to sniff packets in a network to
generate voice quality reports.  The advantage of using the mode where RTP
packets are sniffed is most devices don't support voice quality reports
and the Reaper can be used to analyze a portion of the network so that
fingers can be pointed.

The low cost device for sniffing should have two NICs. There is a shell script
to generate a deb file and it has been tested on some Ubuntu distros.

In order to work properly, the voice packets and signalling packets must be
on the same network.
