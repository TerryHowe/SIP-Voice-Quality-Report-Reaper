The SIP RTCP Report Reaper is a voice quality analysis tool I wrote in the
Spring of 2010 when I was between contracts.  There are two modes of operation
for the reaper.  It can sniff packets for RTCP reports and RTCP voice quality
reports and generate a publish message to a third party with a voice quality
report or it sniff for RTP packets and attempt to generate its own voice
quality report.  This is all in accordance with the following RFC:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-johnston-sipping-rtcp-summary-08

The idea is to use a inexpensive device to sniff packets in a network to
generate voice quality reports.  That advantage of using the mode where RTP
packets are sniffed is most devices don't support voice quality reports anyway
and it analyzes a portion of the network so that problems can be detected and
fingers can be pointed.
