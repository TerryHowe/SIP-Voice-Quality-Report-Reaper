The SIP Voice Quality Report Reaper is a voice quality analysis tool I wrote
in the Spring of 2010 when I was between contracts.  There are two modes of
operation for the reaper.  It can sniff packets for RTCP reports and RTCP
voice quality reports and generate a publish message to a third party with a
voice quality report or it sniff for RTP packets and attempt to generate its
own voice quality report.  This is all in accordance with the following RFC:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-johnston-sipping-rtcp-summary-08

The tool is designed to sniff packets on a network and generate voice quality
reports most likely to another network.  The advantage of using the mode where
RTP packets are sniffed is most devices don't support voice quality reports
and the Reaper can be used to analyze a segment of the network so that
fingers can be pointed.

There is a shell script to generate an installable deb file and it has been
tested on some Ubuntu distros.

In order to work properly, the RTP voice packets and the SIP signalling packets
must be on the same network.

The tool is written in Java with some C code to customize tcpdump so that it
can be used as a Berkeley Packet Filter for the Reaper.
